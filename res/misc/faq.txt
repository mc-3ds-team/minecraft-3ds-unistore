Where can I find a download link for Minecraft: New Nintendo 3DS Edition?

I have a non-USA system. What title ID do I use?

The USA title ID is 00040000001B8700, the EU title ID is 000400000017CA00, and the JP title ID is 000400000017FD00. 
-------------------
How can I play online multiplayer?

Unfortunately, this version of Minecraft only has two-player local multiplayer player, which means online multiplayer is not possible. If you want to play with your friends on your New 3DS/2DS, you'll have to be in close proximity to them. If you're playing on Citra, however, you can use netplay to play online with your friends. However, this method of multiplayer is very unstable. It's also worth noting that a mod that adds online multiplayer would not work well (or at all, for that matter) due to the limitations of the New 3DS/2DS family of systems.

A similar situation occurred with the Stranger Things skin pack, where it was taken down from the store in the second half of 2022.
